# BMTC Bus Timing Prediction

The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) is responsible for running the buses in Bangalore, India. However, the bus schedule published by the BMTC seems to assume that the buses move at a uniform speed at all times which leads to delays and a schedule that no one looks at. 

Given that the bus stops cannot have a dynamic schedule, the next best thing would be to create a schedule accounting for the changes in traffic patterns which is what we have worked on here. Given the locations of 6000 buses recorded roughly every minute for a week, we created a model to predict the time it would take for a bus to reach between any two points in Bangalore. 

This was done as a project for the 2018 *511 Machine Learning* course. A report can be found [here](https://gulu42.github.io/assets/pdf/bmtc_report.pdf).
